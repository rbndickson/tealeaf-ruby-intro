#    Study the following code and state what will be printed...and why:
#    I did this before I think - the string is unchanged, the array changes

#    Because... for the string the method is acting upon a new string
#    object, so old one is unchanged. For the array the method acts upon the
#    orginal (the same) object using <<

# As before, the explanation is all about what Ruby does with its internal
# variables when we change the object it points to. Does it create a new one?
# Or is it able to just modify the existing object?

# In this case, the String#gsub! method is smart enough to compare the length
# of the before and after string and see they are the same, so it has no
# particular reason to make a new string!

# With the Array#= assignment, our literal ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] array IS
# a new object, and we are setting the internal array variable equal to that
# new array literal object.
