# 3. One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is
#    that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string
#    and modify it with various parameters from our program.

#    Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and
#    gender of each family member:

munsters = {
    "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },

# 4. In an earlier exercise we saw that depending on variables to be modified
#    by called methods can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabega"
  an_array_param << "rutabega"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

#    We learned that when the above "coincidentally" does what we think
#    we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.
#    How can we refactor this exercise to make the result easier to predict
#    and easier for the next programmer to maintain?

#    Do not really understand this question. Answer is below
my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]

def not_so_tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabega"
  an_array_param += ["rutabega"]

end

a_string_param, an_array_param = not_so_tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

#    So in the non tricky one the original array is unchanged

# 7. One day Spot was playing with the Munster familiy's home computer
#    and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

munsters = {
     "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
     "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
     "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
     "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
     "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}

#    After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa
#    could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:

mess_with_demographics(munsters)
p munsters
#    Did the family's data get ransacked, or did the mischeif only mangle a
#    local copy of the original hash? (why?)

#    Yes it all changed. The program worked on the actual munsters hash

# 8. In a previous exercise we created a monkey patch for the

#    Write a new patch called pretty_short_version which will return a
#    string that ends on a word boundary and is never longer than the
#    length parameter.

#    If the first word is too long, the solution should fall back to just
#    shortening the first word.
#    Don't forget to leave room for and append the ellipsis at the end.
